# Nexus Trace

Monorepo for a fullâ€‘stack app with a Node.js + TypeScript backend (`server`) and
a frontend (`client`). Uses **pnpm workspaces**, **Corepack**, **ESM**, and a
modern toolchain (tsx, tsup, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier).

> Goal: clean, scalable, and interviewâ€‘ready architecture with sensible
> defaults.
