## Highlights
- Hybrid retrieval via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) keeps both lexical and semantic results relevant.
- Direct-to-S3 uploads, CloudFront caching, and content-hash keys make file handling fast and safe.
- Background workers, rate limiting, and circuit breakers keep `/search` responsive even when AI providers wobble.
- Unified observability stack (traces, logs, metrics) powers Grafana dashboards and alerting.

## Core Capabilities
### Capture & Organize
- Markdown note authoring with tagging.
- Attachments for PDFs and images stored on S3 with immutable content hashes.

### Search & Retrieval
- PostgreSQL full-text search for precise keyword matches.
- pgvector-backed embeddings for semantic recall.
- RRF fusion of lexical and vector rankings, with tag and date filters.

### Reliability & Observability
- Token-bucket rate limiting on critical routes (`/ai/*`, `/search`).
- Idempotent background jobs with exponential backoff + jitter to prevent retry storms.
- OpenTelemetry spans from UI → API → DB/Redis/OpenAI, structured logging with Pino, and Prometheus metrics surfaced in Grafana dashboards and alerts.

## Architecture & Stack
### Runtime & Tooling
- **Node.js** 22 LTS with **TypeScript**
- **pnpm** workspaces (>= 10)

### Frontend
- **Next.js** + **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for styling

### Backend
- **Express** (TypeScript)
- **Zod** for input validation
- **Pino** for structured logging

### Background Workers
- Redis + BullMQ (Upstash) for queues, retries, priorities, and metrics
- Idempotency via content hashes; exponential backoff with jitter and a circuit breaker for external calls
- Queue depth, throughput, and failure metrics exported for dashboards

### Data & Search
- PostgreSQL 17 (Neon) with Prisma ORM
- pgvector for embeddings and similarity search
- PostgreSQL FTS (`tsvector`) for lexical search
- Hybrid retrieval measured with nDCG/MRR to stay within latency budgets

### AI Integrations
- Voyage for embeddings and rerank
- gloq for concise summaries

### File Storage & CDN
- S3 presigned PUT uploads for browser clients (direct-to-S3)
- CloudFront for edge caching and private-bucket access via OAC

### Observability
- Traces: OpenTelemetry → Grafana Cloud Tempo
- Logs: Pino JSON logs enriched with `traceId/orgId/userId` → Grafana Cloud Loki
- Metrics: `prom-client` → Grafana Cloud Prometheus; dashboards cover route latency (p50/p95/p99), error rates, DB performance, queue health, AI outcomes; two alerts watch API p99 latency and worker failure rate

### Reliability & Security
- Graceful shutdown for API and workers
- Organization-scoped authentication across routes and queries

### CI/CD & Deployment
- GitHub Actions for type checks, linting, tests, build, Docker, and deploy
- Vercel (frontend), Render/Railway/Fly (backend)
- Neon (PostgreSQL), Upstash (Redis), Grafana Cloud (Tempo/Loki/Prometheus)
- AWS S3 + CloudFront for asset storage and delivery

## Architecture Decision Records
Architectural choices are documented in ADRs. See the index at [docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md).

## Why These Choices Work Together
- **Performance & relevancy:** Combining Postgres FTS with pgvector embeddings delivers balanced recall and precision without introducing a separate vector database.
- **Operational clarity:** Shared tracing IDs across logs, metrics, and traces give quick insight into tenant-level behaviour.
- **Resilience:** Circuit breakers, backoff, and rate limits contain third-party failures and maintain predictable latency.

# 🏢 Tenant Structure

### Concept
- **Tenant = Organization.**  
  Each tenant represents an organization or workspace.  
- **TenantMembership** links users to tenants with specific roles (`owner`, `admin`, `member`).  
  This drives authorization logic for API guards and UI visibility.

### Session Management
- Keep the **currentTenantId** in the session:
  - Store in **Express session** (server-side).
  - Mirror in **NextAuth token** so the frontend knows the active tenant.
- When a user switches tenants, update both:
  - **Client** → persist via `cookie` or `localStorage`.
  - **Server** → store in the session for subsequent requests.

### Tenant Switcher
- Provide a dropdown in the header.
- Fetch memberships from `/v1/tenants`.
- When user selects a tenant:
  - Persist selection client-side and server-side.
  - All requests automatically include the correct `tenantId`.

---

# 📄 Document Display

### Dashboard Landing
- Show **recent documents** for the selected tenant.
  - Columns: `title`, `createdAt`, `status`.
- Add filters/tabs:
  - `All`, `Drafts`, `Processing`, `Published`.

### Document Page Layout
- **Left Pane** – Metadata:
  - Tags, reminders, attachments.
- **Center Pane** – Content:
  - Markdown or LLM-generated summary.
- **Right Pane** – History:
  - Commands, workflow logs, and AI task history.

### Indexing Status
- Integrate **IndexJob** table data.
- Display status:
  - 🟡 `Processing`
  - 🟢 `Indexed`
  - 🔴 `Failed` (include Retry button)

### Command Activity Timeline
- For automated actions (reminders, summaries, etc.):
  - Show activity timeline.
  - Include next scheduled reminder or last triggered event.

# ⚙️ Flow of the Project

### 1. Tenant Creation & Onboarding
- Owner can create new tenants.
- Invite members via **email token**.
- Assign roles during invite or later (owner/admin/member).
- Enforce access control:
  - Only `owner` or `admin` can invite/manage members.

### 2. Document Creation
- Start from the dashboard → `New Document`.
- Choose type:
  - 📝 **Note** (inline editor)
  - 🔗 **Link** (URL ingestion)
  - 📎 **Upload** (file picker)
- On submission:
  - Save to DB.
  - Enqueue async processing jobs (indexing, reminder setup, AI digest).

### 3. Async Tasks
- Handle in background workers:
  - Indexing, summarization, reminders.
- Frontend shows **live status** using:
  - Polling or **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** from `/v1/documents/:id`.

### 4. Command Ingestion
- After document creation:
  - Parse embedded or explicit commands.
  - Attach parsed commands to the document.
  - Push jobs for:
    - Reminders 🕒
    - Formatting 🧩
    - Digest/summarization 🤖
- Store outputs (summaries, reminders) back into document fields or related tables.

### 5. Search
- Tenant-scoped search:
  - Endpoint: `/api/search`
  - Filters: command type, tags, reminder status.
  - Display snippet previews from `searchVector`.

### 6. Notifications
- Trigger reminders via worker:
  - Send **emails** or **push notifications**.
- Record each event in the `Reminder` table:
  - Prevent duplicates.
  - Show full reminder history in the document timeline.

**✅ Summary**
This structure enables:
- Multi-tenant isolation with role-based access.
- Seamless tenant switching and scoped data.
- Clear document workflows from creation → automation → reminders → search.
- Transparency through live indexing states and command histories.
